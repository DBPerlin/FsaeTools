## ⚠️ Work Still in Progress...

## Overview
This project consists of a **web-based inventory management system** designed to facilitate the control of stock levels, item expiration dates, and the condition of components used by teams registred in the *Fórmula SAE Brasil* competition. Beyond inventory control, the platform also serves as **an interactive and educational space** promoting **proper waste disposal** through a sustainability-focused module!

The system features a modern and intuitive interface, offering clear visual insights into inventory status and environmental engagement. It is composed of four main modules: **Dashboard**, **Inventory**, **Add Item**, and **Be Green**.
